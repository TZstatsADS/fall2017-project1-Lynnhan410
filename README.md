# Fall 2017
# Project 1: What did the presidents say at their inauguation?


The purpose of my project

As we know, America have become the only superpower after the cold war and Donald J Trump became the 45th America presidents on Jaunary 20th, 2017. Compared to other presidents in the past, he seems so different. He seems highly emotional, highly bold, highly mischievous and highly sociable which conflicts with our traditional knowledge of politicians. So people may ask "Is he really like an alien compared to other presidents?" In this project, in order to coincide with the background of the times, we will investigate about it through inaugural speeches of presdents after cold war.
